# Update 2

## Overview

We have been working on taking our progress, results, and findings from update 1 and building our analyses on top of that here in order to keep extracting
valuable information regarding our fish and water data. We also had to overcome a few obstacles with respect to matching our two datasets we have (fish and water)
to each other so that we can analyze the fish and water datasets together. For example, in order to be able to easily see what the water characteristics were when a
certain fish species was very dominant. We have been making more visualizations, more processed datasets , as well as drawing together various correlations in order to start to draw out correlations between the makeup of fish and water characteristics (specifically pH). Finally, we also worked on taking our water dataset, and being able to interpolate what the pH should be at a given place and time based on the other water characteristics we do have available in the dataset.

## Making More Processed Datasets

### Subsetting the Fish Dataset to Match the Water Dataset Sample Locations/Times

### Grouping and splitting the Fish Dataset by Location

### Finsing the Most Abundant Fish Species at a given location at a Given Time (and storing in a dataset)

## Some Intermediate Correlations

## Heatmaps of Water Characteristics

## Interpolating pH Values
