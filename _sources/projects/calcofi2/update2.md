# Update 2

## Overview

We have been working on taking our progress, results, and findings from update 1 and building our analyses on top of that here in order to keep extracting
valuable information regarding our fish and water data. We also had to overcome a few obstacles with respect to matching our two datasets we have (fish and water)
to each other so that we can analyze the fish and water datasets together. For example, in order to be able to easily see what the water characteristics were when a
certain fish species was very dominant.
